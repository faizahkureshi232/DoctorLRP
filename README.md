# **Doctor LRP: Explainable AI for Medical Imaging**

Welcome to **Doctor LRP**, a robust implementation of **Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)** paired with object detection, designed to enhance explainability in medical imaging. This project focuses on detecting **brain tumors** and **Alzheimer's disease** using **CT** and **MRI scans**, providing interpretable diagnostics through Explainable AI (XAI).

---

## **Key Features**
- **Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)**: Gain interpretable insights into neural network predictions for medical scans.
- **Object Detection**: Pinpoints areas of concern (e.g., tumor regions) in CT/MRI scans using bounding boxes.
- **Disease Classification**: Accurately detects brain tumors and Alzheimer's disease from medical images.
- **Explainability in AI**: Bridges the gap between AI predictions and clinical understanding by visualizing feature relevance.

---

## **Use Cases**
- **Brain Tumor Detection**: Identify tumor regions in CT/MRI scans and explain predictions with LRP.
- **Alzheimer's Disease Analysis**: Detect early signs of Alzheimer's using MRI scans, with transparent model decision-making.
- **Medical Imaging Research**: A valuable tool for researchers exploring explainable AI in healthcare.

---

## **Technologies and Tools**
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **PyTorch**: Framework for building and training deep learning models.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and object detection.
- **LRP Library**: Custom implementation for interpretability.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of heatmaps and object detection results.
